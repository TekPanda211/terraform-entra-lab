\# BlackKnight One Dashboard



\## Overview



The BlackKnight One Dashboard is the primary entry point for the platform.



Rather than requiring users to remember individual PowerShell commands, the dashboard provides a centralized, menu-driven interface for launching assessments, viewing reports, and managing platform operations.



The dashboard is intended to be the standard way users interact with BlackKnight One.

\- Delegated authentication



The dashboard establishes the connection before launching the selected assessment engine.

\# Design Principles



The dashboard was designed around the following principles.



\## Single Entry Point



Users begin with one command:



```powershell

Show-BKDashboard

```



\## Consistent Navigation



Every platform component follows the same navigation model.



\## Discoverability



Available assessments are visible from the dashboard without requiring knowledge of PowerShell command names.



\## Extensibility



New assessment engines can be added to the dashboard without changing the user experience.
