# BlackKnight One

Infrastructure Assessment Platform for Terraform, Microsoft Graph, Identity, and Security

---

## Overview

BlackKnight One is an enterprise PowerShell platform designed to assess, analyze, and validate modern cloud infrastructure.

The platform combines Terraform engineering, Microsoft Graph discovery, identity analysis, and security assessments into a single dashboard-driven experience with standardized reporting and executive scoring.

## North Star

BlackKnight One exists to become the definitive assessment platform for Microsoft cloud, identity, infrastructure, and security engineering.

The vision is to provide a single, consistent platform capable of assessing, validating, and correlating infrastructure across Terraform, Microsoft Graph, Azure, Microsoft 365, and future cloud technologies.

Every assessment engine should answer three fundamental questions:

1. What exists?
2. Is it healthy, secure, and compliant?
3. What should be done next?

BlackKnight One is designed around a common assessment model so that every engine—regardless of technology—produces standardized findings, confidence scoring, executive summaries, and actionable recommendations.

The long-term objective is to provide engineers, architects, consultants, and security professionals with a single platform capable of evaluating an organization's cloud posture from infrastructure to identity.

## Vision

One platform.

One dashboard.

One assessment model.
